# Draft U.S. Web Design Standards

[![CircleCI Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/18F/web-design-standards/tree/staging.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/18F/web-design-standards/tree/staging)

The [Draft U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov) include a library of open source UI components and a visual style guide for U.S. federal government websites.

These tools follow industry-standard web accessibility guidelines and use the best practices of existing style libraries and modern web design. Created and maintained by [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) designers and developers, the Draft Web Design Standards are designed for use by government product teams who want to create beautiful, easy-to-use online experiences for the public. To learn more about the project, check out this [blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/28/web-design-standards/).

## Getting started

We’re glad you’d like to use the Standards — here’s how you can get started:

* Designers: [Check out our Getting Started for Designers information](https://standards.usa.gov/getting-started/).
    * [Design files of all the assets included on this site are available for download](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards-assets/archive/master.zip).
* Developers: Follow the instructions in this README to get started.
    * [CSS, JavaScript, image, and font files of all the assets on this site are available for download](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/releases/download/v0.11.1/uswds-0.11.1.zip).

Here are a few different ways to use the Standards within your project.

## Download

To use the Draft Web Design Standards on your project, you’ll need to include the CSS and JavaScript files in each HTML page in your project.

First, download the Draft Web Design Standards assets:

[https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/releases/download/v0.11.1/uswds-0.11.1.zip](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/releases/download/v0.11.1/uswds-0.11.1.zip)

Then, add the following folders into a relevant place in your code base — likely a directory where you keep third-party libraries:

```

uswds-0.11.1/
├── js/
│   ├── uswds.min.js.map
│   ├── uswds.min.js
│   └── uswds.js
├── css/
│   ├── uswds.min.css.map
│   ├── uswds.min.css
│   └── uswds.css
├── img/
└── fonts/
```

Refer to these files by adding the following `<link>` and `<script>` elements
into your HTML pages:

Add this to your `<head>` element:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/your/assets/css/lib/uswds.min.css">
```

Add this before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="/path/to/your/assets/js/lib/uswds.min.js"></script>
```

We offer two versions — a minified version, and an un-minified one. Use the minified version in a production environment or to reduce the file size
of your downloaded assets. And the un-minified version is better if you are in a
development environment or would like to debug the CSS or JavaScript assets in
the browser. The examples above recommend using the minified versions.

This version of the Standards includes jQuery version `2.2.0` bundled within the
JavaScript file. Please make sure that you're not including any other version
of jQuery on your page.

And that’s it — you should be set to use the Standards.

## Using npm

If you have `node` installed on your machine, you can use npm to install the Standards. Add `uswds`
to your project's `package.json` as a dependency:

```shell
npm install --save uswds
```

The package will be installed in `node_modules/uswds`. You can use the un-compiled files
found in the `src/` or the compiled files in the `dist/` directory.

```
node_modules/uswds/
├── dist/
│   ├── css/
│   ├── fonts/
│   ├── img/
│   ├── js/
└── src/
    ├── fonts/
    ├── img/
    ├── js/
    └── stylesheets/
```

`require('uswds')` will load all of the Draft U.S. Web Design Standard's JavaScript onto the page. The `uswds` module itself does not export anything.

The main Sass (SCSS) source file is here:

```
node_modules/uswds/src/stylesheets/all.scss
```

The non-minified CSS that’s been precompiled is here:

```
node_modules/uswds/dist/css/uswds.css
```

## Using another framework or package manager

If you’re using another framework or package manager that doesn’t support NPM, you can find the source files in this repository and use them in your project. Otherwise, we recommend that you follow the [download instructions](#download). Please note that the core team [isn’t responsible for all frameworks’ implementations](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/issues/877).

If you’re interested in maintaining a package that helps us distribute the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards, the project's build system can help you create distribution bundles to use in your project. Please read our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#building-the-project-locally-with--gulp-) to locally build distributions for your framework or package manager.

## Our use of branches

The `staging` branch is the bleeding edge of development. When developing, we create a feature branch from `staging`, do our work in that branch, and then create a pull request that merges back into `staging`. New commits to `staging` are automatically deployed to [our staging site](https://standards-staging.usa.gov/).

The `master` branch always holds the latest production-ready release, as well as [the production website](https://standards.usa.gov/). When cutting a [release](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/releases), we create a release branch from `staging` named for the new version: for example, `v0.9.x`. Once we've completed QA on that branch, we tag the release and merge it into the `master` branch.

The branches `18f-pages` and `18f-pages-staging` _used_ to be the primary release and development branches, back when the site was hosted on `pages.18f.gov`. Those branches still auto deploy to 18F Pages, but will now only contain minimal redirects to the new site.

## Reuse of open-source style guides

Much of the guidance in the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards leans on open source designs, code, and patterns from other civic and government organizations, including:

* Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s [Design Manual](https://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/)
* U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s [Design Patterns](http://uspto.github.io/designpatterns/)
* Healthcare.gov [Style Guide](http://styleguide.healthcare.gov/)
* UK’s Government Digital Service’s [UI Elements](http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/)
* Code for America’s Chime [Styleguide](https://github.com/chimecms/chime-starter)
* Pivotal Labs [Component Library](http://styleguide.cfapps.io/)
