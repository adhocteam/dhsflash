    <h4>Make the best thing the easiest thing.</h4>
    <p>By offering open-source, quick-to-download code and assets, the Standards make it easy to deliver the highest-quality government websites to the public.</p>

    </div>
    <h4>Offer accessibility out of the box.</h4>
    <p>Every asset we offer meets the high accessibility standards outlined in Section 508. Want to customize the Standards? Not a problem — we also make recommendations for tools you can use to assess your site’s accessibility.</p>

    <h4>Design for flexibility.</h4>
    <p>Our patterns and designs are easy to adapt. The Standards encourage consistency over uniformity, which benefits your users and you: The American people feel a sense of familiarity with each site they visit, and you can customize your designs to your agency.</p>

    </div>
    <h4>Reuse, reuse, reuse.</h4>
    <p>No one likes reinventing the wheel. To create the Standards, we reviewed, tested, and repurposed patterns, code, and designs from dozens of government and private-sector style guides. The result? A comprehensive collection of tried-and-true assets that reflect industry best practices.</p>
