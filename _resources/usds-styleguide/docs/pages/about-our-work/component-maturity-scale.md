title: Component maturity scale
category: About our work
lead: The component maturity scale is a way to indicate the level of robustness of any component or asset within the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards. Best practices for agile delivery include releasing software incrementally, before itâ€™s perfect. We can (and should) release new items in the Standards following this principle, and we assess each component independently of every other component or the library as a whole.
---

We communicate the robustness of each new pattern in two ways: by displaying its maturity level in the UI for each particular component, and by indicating its maturity in release notes and other documentation.

For more information on how a component moves from one maturity level to the next, please review our draft design [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/blob/staging/CONTRIBUTING.md). They define, in detail, the assessments and activities our team conducts to determine whether a component is ready to move to the next level.

Our system is inspired by http://usajobs.github.io/design-system/getting-started/#maturity, who outline a maturity scale of their own in their Getting Started and who use these labels on the individual component page.

## Hypothesis
### Definitions of done
* The user need has been identified, but the approach to solving the problem has not yet been decided.
* The core team has decided to tackle this UI pattern.
* The pattern has been listed in the public roadmap.

## Proposed
### Definitions of done
Includes everything from the hypothesis phase, as well as:

* Identifies what user need the pattern solves.
* Lists alternative patterns that support this user need (along with reasons why the submitted pattern is the best choice).
* Includes a rendering of the design: a wireframe, design mock-up, interaction pattern, prototype, or (link to) a finished pattern.
* Describes any primary or secondary research that supports this pattern (include who you tested with, what kind of research you conducted, and links to any supporting documentation, including interview protocols, prototype used, and so on).

## Alpha
### Definitions of done
Includes everything from the proposed phase, which has been reviewed by the design team, as well as:

* The pattern has passed all heuristic assessments.
* Our team hasn't surfaced any secondary research that would explicitly reject the pattern (Alternatively: The person submitting the pattern has attached secondary research that supports it).

## Beta
### Definitions of done
Includes everything from the proposed and alpha phases, as well as:

* Pattern is generally usable, on multiple devices, for people with relatively "normal" digital literacy.
* Pattern works in multiple configurations with other components in the Standards.
* First draft of documentation is written.
* Pattern is available in beta in the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards.

## Recommended
### Definitions of done
Includes everything in the proposed, alpha, and beta phases, as well as:

* Pattern is usable, on multiple devices, by people with multiple disabilities (blind, low vision, cognitive disabilities, motor disabilities, low language skills, low digital literacy, and more).
* Documentation, including context of use rationale, is complete.
* Pattern has been in beta for [period of time] and external teams report few problems using it.

## Deprecated
### Definitions of done
* Pattern has been removed from the pattern library and design stencils.
* Pattern has been marked deprecated in release notes.

### This is the end of the line, folks.
